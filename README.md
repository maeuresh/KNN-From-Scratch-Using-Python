# KNN-From-Scratch-Using-Python

This project implements the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm from scratch using Python. KNN is a simple, non-parametric, and lazy learning algorithm that classifies new data points based on their similarity to the nearest neighbors in the training dataset. It is widely used in classification and regression tasks.
